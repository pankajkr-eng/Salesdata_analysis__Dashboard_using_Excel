# Salesdata_analysis__Dashboard_using_Excel

To create an Excel dashboard for sales data, I first focused on data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats. Once the data was cleaned, I created various tables and pivot tables to organize the information effectively. These tables allowed for dynamic sorting and filtering, making it easier to analyze different aspects of the sales data.

Next, I designed a series of charts and graphs, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, to visually represent key metrics such as sales trends, product performance, and regional sales distribution. By combining these visual elements on a single page, I built a comprehensive dashboard that provided clear and actionable insights.
